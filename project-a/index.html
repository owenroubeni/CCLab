                The Jellyfluxfish (Chromomedusa Fluxaris-7) is a rare, color-shifting jellyfish that reacts to light and pollution, glowing blue-green in the dark and turning pink in bright conditions. It tends to live in isolation, rarely found with others of its kind. Marine biologists study its bioluminescence and adaptability to understand the condition of the ocean.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Given you are a scientist in a Yellow Submarine, there is no way to directly interact with the Jellyfluxfish. Instead, observing the creature from the inside of the Submarine allows you to press a button. This button reveals the pollution in the ocean, making the Jellyfluxfish react. The trash also has an effect on color and movement.
